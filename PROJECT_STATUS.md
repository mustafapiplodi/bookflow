## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Decisions Made
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui (customizable, accessible, TypeScript-first)
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state, TanStack Query for server state
- **Rich Text**: Tiptap (extensible, modern)
- **Charts**: Recharts (React-native, composable)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS + real-time)

### Architecture Patterns
- **App Router**: Using Next.js 14 App Router
- **Data Fetching**: Server Components where possible, client components with React Query
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with SSR
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
